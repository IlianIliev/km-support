Our [Metrics][metrics] tool is a quick way to visualize the performance of individual events or properties.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is a quick look at the health of your site, through the lens of your metrics. Values on the dashboard update roughly every 24 hours, but you can dive into an individual metric to get the most up-to-date number. If we detect that your metrics haven't updated in a while, we'll also try to update all of your metrics.

## Individual Metric Details

Clicking into an individual metric gives you visibility on the metric's performance over time, as well as maximum, minimum, and averages.

![Individual Metric][individual-metric]

That "Overall Signup Conversion Rate" value in the center of your metric is calculated on-the-fly each time, and will show the most up-to-date value.

### Histogram

For some of our metrics, we provide a histogram of the distribution, so you can visually gauge if outliers are affecting the calculation. You can toggle between this histogram view and viewing the individual raw data.

![Histogram][histogram]

The histogram is visible in these metrics:

* Number of Times Event Happened
* Average Number of Times Event Happened Per Person
* Average Time Between Events
* Total Value for Property
* Average Value for Property

### Segmenting a Metric

At the bottom of each metric, you can segment your metric along any of your KISSmetrics properties. Example uses include:

* Gauge performance of a metric based on which referring site or ad campaign each visitor came from
* Gauge how well a particular A/B test performed in each test condition

![Metric Segment][metric-segment]

*Note: remember that we track a person's lifecycle on your site, which includes every referral source they took to reach your site. Choosing `First ever` or `Last ever` lets you attribute a person to either the first property they received (usually for `Referrer` or `Campaign Name`), or to the most recent property.*
