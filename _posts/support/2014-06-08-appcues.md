[Appcues][appcues] is an application for converting and retaining customers.

With Appcues **AND** KISSmetrics, you can see how users engage with your Appcues interfaces. KISSmetrics reports will help you answer:

* How well do customers understand my product?
* Which in-app notifications are most effective?
* How does onboarding affect my conversion rate?
* Where and why are customers getting confused?

## Setup

1. After loading your Appcues embed script, simply run `Appcues.initKM()` to activate the KISSmetrics integration.
2. Read the [Appcues Documenation][appcues-docs] for advanced options.
3. Watch Appcues data appear in KISSmetrics' Live tab and other reports.


#### Frequency of Import

* Appcues data is immediately sent to KISSmetrics whenever users are shown and interact with an Appcues flow.
